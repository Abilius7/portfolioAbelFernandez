                            It was my final degree project to end my studies, I developed a system who can monitor
                            <span> the
                                most practical data of your old vehicle</span>, as well this software can show you this
                            data in
                            real time on your smartphone and it can show you data plots of your vehicle. Also I
                            developed
                            the web store to this product, getting <span>the best mark of my promotion</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sistem consist on an <span> Arduino </span> with some sensors like a flow meter, a
                            speedometer and
                            infrared sensor to know the volume of fuel on your tank.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We get this data from the vehicle and show the user this data merged, for example we can
                            show the user the <span>fuel consumption per 100 Km </span> or how the speed is related to
                            the fuel consumption.
                        </p>

                            In my end of year proyectfor programing subject, where we've learned about <span>the basics
                                of
                                OOP</span>, Data Bases like MySQL and Oracle, and we've done grafical interfaces, we
                            should have being using all our knowledge to develop it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This project has been developed buy a 4 student's group in around 3 weeks. In the group I
                            have been coordinating and checking. And finally our profesor have given us the <span>best
                                mark
                                when we have presented it</span>.

                        <p>
                            This software manages several <span>institutes and higschools</span>. Even so, you can add
                            new ones, with it's degrees and students.

                        <p>
                            Nowadays it isn't working because we have being using a free external data base that is not
                            working now. But we have developed a sql file and if it would be necessary I am able to
                            create a new data basa to make it work again.

                            It was an initiative that was carried out online in which we should<span> develop a
                                proyect</span> selecting a theme relationated whith the covid-19 problems by groups. It
                            was not focused on technological develop but in business
                            development of an idea .
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our team decided to develop the bussines logic of a software which allows familly and
                            friends get a funny time together, but whithout fisical contact, <span>to protect themselves
                                from
                                Covid-19</span>.

                        <p>
                            This APP will allow to the users create, play and punctuate <span>challenges</span> which
                            the users can share with his <span>familly and friends</span> for a fun and safty time.

                            It take we 3 days and a lot of work by goups of 4 people, in which we learn many things
                            about <span>bussines development </span>and all of their points of view, and the importance
                            of the teams work. And specially it was a great

                        <p>
                            A good friend of mine use to write<span> poems</span>. He had an organization problem so he
                            decided to ask me for a solution, and for that reason I developed a software to solve that
                            problem.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At that time, and basing on his needs, I started designing a suitable software for him. As I
                            consider myself skilled on <span>Java</span> programing, I use it with MySQL to create what
                            he needed. We decided to <span>divide his texts</span> in 3 different categories basing on
                            what kind of literally text they were, then we added some more subcategories to search them
                            more precisely.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once finished the software and solved my friend's problem, we decided to add some <span>
                                features</span> to the software like an algorithm that sort all of his proyect by the
                            most used word and the word count
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Actually I'm thinking do not use data bases and use binary data storage. I use database
                            because I need to practise it for my examns and it was an amazing oportunity.
                        </p>
                        <p>Actually it's not working because we use a free external data base, and it's not working now.
                            But we develop a sql file and if required I can create a <span>new data base and it would
                                work again</span>.
